				What is the Mega Challenge?
			</x-slot>
			<x-slot name="answer">
				<p>Each student will be given a packet of verses to memorize. They can pick and choose which verse they want to work on. For each verse they say to their sponsor, their name is turned into the Mega Challenge bucket on the stage. Each day a drawing will take place, and students could receive a prize from their names being turned in. There will be two ways to turn names in. One is putting their name on the white slips of paper that are titled, “Mega Challenge”. The other way is to send a text to us. If you have unlimited texting in your phone plan, then it will not be any extra expense to do this.</p>

				What are the Rubber Duckie awards?
			</x-slot>
			<x-slot name="answer">
				<p>Everyday there will be a drawing for rubber duckies on the stage when everyone is in the tabernacle. Any type of an action that a student is going out of their way to help others is considered a good deed. Our reason for this award is to assist sponsors in having another incentive for positive behavior for the week. This is also another way to have fun! When a student does something well, let them know and turn their name into the labeled rubber duckie bucket on the stage.</p>

				<p>There are two ways to turn students names in. One is putting their name on the yellow slips of paper that are titled, "Rubber Duckies". The other way is to send a text to us. Details on how to submit names via text message will be in your survival guide.</p>

				What is the individual quiet time?
			</x-slot>
			<x-slot name="answer">
				<p>Students are given a chance to take time out to do the student devotion in their student book for that day in the cabin. This is a great opportunity for the campers to learn how to have their own time with God. Sponsors will need to encourage their students to take time to do this and be in the cabin with them.</p>
