We are now hosting camp at the Texas Baptist Encampment in Palacious, TX. Located on the beautiful Gulf Coast of Southeast Texas; on the shores of Tres Palacios Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico. TBE enjoys the beauty of God's creation and an exceptional climate, year-round. It has been in existence since 1902, making it the oldest camp west of the Mississippi River. TBE has a diverse array of high-quality facilities, a very accommodating servant-hearted staff, an especially unique & picturesque waterfront, a friendly atmosphere, and a laid-back personality. <strong>You'll love it here!</strong></p>
